## Task Overview

For this task, you will be required to expand the testing coverage for the Next To Go web application provided to you. The site and Cypress can be launched with the above setup commands.

There is no "correct" solution for this task per se; it will be at your discretion to add coverage for components/functionality which you feel would be necessary to assure the quality of such an application. The intention of this task is to allow us insight into your ability to analyse a problem and develop thorough, holistic solutions in an automation framework such as Cypress.

Two specs, along with a pre-filled spec file for your reference, have been created within the ```cypress/e2e/``` directory.

## Task Requirements
- Add tests to the ```countdown-timer``` and ```filters``` specs for each spec's respective components/functionality
- Add more general coverage to the ```content.cy.ts``` spec to which you feel is necessary

## Additional Considerations

The below points are not strict requirements for the test, but more so some aspects which you may want to implement/consider in your solution.

- Race response mocking
- Negative scenario testing (e.g. failed network requests)
- Small summaries of any bugs/issues you witness whilst implementing your solution

All additional coverage added which has not been explicitly asked for will strengthen your submission.

## Issues/Support

If you encounter any issues or have any questions regarding the task, please do not hesitate to reach out to your recruiter and we will endevour to address your concerns as soon as possible.
